Lindgaard has been signed to Manchester United and been on loans to Leicester City, Birmingham, Brighton & Hove Albion, Derby County, West Ham United.

Upon arriving at Twitter HQ he brought with him a physical sink, referencing the meme which is a word play of the same phrase. This was posted on Twitter as a video and has reached 47.7M views as of writing this. The painting is made of a combination of an illustration of Elon Musk (made by VectorStock artist: “Vectorfarmer”, a comic book background (freepik), a comic book speech bubble and a cartoon style sink (made by Dreamstime artist: “Blueringmedia”).’`

The image is from the show's poster on IMDB, but we removed some of the other characters and added a preferable "Clubhouse".`

We combined this with a black and white screen grab of "Tom & Jerry: The Movie" from 2021. Seeing as they've had a feud going for the past 83 years we saw this as a fitting design.`

A phenomenon where members of the WallStreetBets Reddit forum coordinated to buy GME stock and options, causing the stock price to soar and creating losses for short sellers who bet against the company's stock. We combined the forums logo with a green stock curve in front of a city landscape. Whilst writing this the forum still hasn't acknowledged our hard work...`

Motivet er originalt laget av brukeren @trapkiidbilly på Pinterest, og vi brukte derfor dette som utgangspunkt og videre kombinerte med et par flere elementer. Musikken hans går i sjangrene Hip hop, trap, og mumble rap. Han kan eksperimentere med sjangerne sine og blir derfor sett på som innflytelsesrik ovenfor sin egen generasjon. Maleriet er 55cm bredt og 46cm høyt."
